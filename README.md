## Requirements and Completed Stretch Goals
- A webpage that simulates bouncing balls on an HTML canvas using physics, math, and JavaScript Objects and Classes.
- Convert from a function prototype to a Class-based prototype.
- Multi-key press, which allows players to move each evil circle at the same time pressing different keys and in a diagonal path (for example, pressing up + left at the same time)
- 2 players mode (red and green evil circle), WASD, and Arrow Keys for 2 players at once. Keep track of both scores.
- Remove the borders so when a ball passes the top of the screen going up, it shows up at the bottom of the screen going the same direction, like asteroids
- Instead of changing the color, try showing a counter of how many times a specific ball has touched another ball when 2 balls touch each other
- Change the colors for each item type so it's easier to look and see what everything is instead of just random colors
- Instead of changing the color, try changing the size when 2 balls touch each other
- Instead of circles, try using a different shape or image/icon/emoji you like
