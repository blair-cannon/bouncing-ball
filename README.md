Requirements
To complete the assignment, you must complete the following:
Complete all eight (8) steps from the MDN instructions
It is easy to just copy their example code, try as hard as you can to type everything on your own, it will benefit you in the long run.
Complete as many stretch goals as you can; they are listed in order of usefulness.

Here is an example of how to extend the Bouncing Balls Project

Stretch Goals
Convert from a function prototype to a Class-based prototype (this is one of the best stretch goals to complete)
Multi-key press, which allows players to move each evil circle at the same time pressing different keys and in a diagonal path (for example, pressing up + left at the same time)
2 players mode (red and green evil circle), WASD, and Arrow Keys for 2 players at once. Keep track of both scores.
Remove the borders so when a ball passes the top of the screen going up, it shows up at the bottom of the screen going the same direction, like asteroids
Instead of changing the color, try showing a counter of how many times a specific ball has touched another ball when 2 balls touch each other
Change the colors for each item type so it's easier to look and see what everything is instead of just random colors
Instead of changing the color, try changing the size when 2 balls touch each other
Instead of circles, try using a different shape or image/icon/emoji you like
